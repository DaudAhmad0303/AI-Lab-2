# Lab Manual
## Task 1
Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
## Task 2
Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.

Formula :
```
C = (F - 32) * (5 / 9)
F = (9 / 5 ) * C + 32
```
[ where C = temperature in celsius and F = temperature in fahrenheit ]

   Expected Output :

```
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius
```
## Task 3
Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.

Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a ***"Well
guessed!"*** message, and the program will exit.
## Task 4
Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

## Task 5
Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
## Task 6
Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

Sample numbers : 
```
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
```
Expected Output :
```
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4
```
